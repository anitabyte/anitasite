  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve taken for granted in the past that if I&rsquo;m on a Raspberry Pi, I&rsquo;m going to have an easy time of getting software for ARM: it&rsquo;s all-but the default platform for which ARM software is built, given the prevalence of the board in the marketplace. This isn&rsquo;t - for now, at least - so true if you&rsquo;re on a 64-bit OS. In spite of the Pi having a 64-bit processor since the Pi 3, the software ecosystem hasn&rsquo;t quite caught up to that. This isn&rsquo;t an issue for things distributed by Debian - all of that ends up in the core repositories and is only an <code>apt install</code> away - but for things distributed in the likes of AppImages or Flatpaks, this poses more of a problem.</p>
<p>I run a 3D printing shop online and use <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases">PrusaSlicer</a> for preparing 3D models for printing. I was pleased to see that there is an ARMv7l AppImage available to download and decided to give it a go, having checked that I&rsquo;d enabled <code>armhf</code> as an architecture using <code>dpkg --add-architecture armhf</code>.</p>
<p>This was not enough to get me to a point where the AppImage would run, with me being told that I was missing <code>ld-linux-armhf.so.3</code>. This made sense, I thought, given that I&rsquo;d only added the architecture&rsquo;s to <code>apt</code>&rsquo;s configuration and not actually installed the packages. I went through some iteration of installing <code>armhf</code> packages before I&hellip; just gave up. Having installed <code>zlib1g:armhf</code>, <code>libfuse2:armhf</code>, <code>libstdc++6:armhf</code>, <code>libbz2-1.0:armhf</code>, <code>liblzma5:armhf</code>, <code>libgl1:armhf</code>, <code>libsm6:armhf</code>, <code>libglib2.0-0:armhf</code>, <code>libatk1.0-0:armhf</code> and <code>libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0:armhf</code>, I realised that I&rsquo;d probably end up installing an entire <code>armhf</code> userland if I carried on this way.</p>
<p>Rather than committing to the eternal iteration of package installs, I decided to bite the bullet and simply compile the application myself. Fortunately, PrusaSlicer&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/blob/master/doc/How%20to%20build%20-%20Linux%20et%20al.md">build instructions</a> are good and complete, providing an accurate list of dependencies and being based on the assumption of a Debian-based system - making them easy enough to follow on Raspberry Pi OS. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be on an 8GB Pi 4, so didn&rsquo;t run into any issues during the linking step: if I were on a 2GB or 4GB Pi, this would likely be a post about ARM cross-compilation. Fortunately we don&rsquo;t have to involve ourselves with the Dark Arts here.</p>
<p>The build itself took about an hour, resulting in a PrusaSlicer binary that happily ran. The performance of the 3D viewport in the application isn&rsquo;t <em>great</em>, but I didn&rsquo;t expect otherwise. Slicing, however, <em>feels</em> competitive with my Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which surprised me. I know that most slicing algorithms are limited by the performance of a single core and don&rsquo;t multithread well, but not being frustrated with how long it took was a pleasant treat to receive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve since found that out that <a href="https://github.com/davidk/PrusaSlicer-ARM.AppImage/releases">someone builds ARM64 PrusaSlicer AppImages and makes them available to download</a>. Oh well.</p>
<p>In my 3D printing workflow, I also use FreeCAD. This was available directly from the Raspberry Pi OS repositories and - again, surprising to me - was perfectly usable on the Pi. I&rsquo;d expected frustrating amounts of latency with graphical updates and recalculations, but it&rsquo;s very useable. This is of course a massively subjective measure of the performance of an application, but it&rsquo;s ultimately the most important one: I feel like I&rsquo;m capable of doing the work I need to do on the Pi without feeling like I&rsquo;m limited by my hardware.</p>
