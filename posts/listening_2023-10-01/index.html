<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crying_in_H_Mart"><em>Crying in H Mart</em></a> and it&rsquo;s already changed how I view Japanese Breakfast&rsquo;s music: everything in <em>Slide Tackle</em>&rsquo;s revisiting of an obsession and wanting to be better has become a matter of the fact that Michelle Zauner&rsquo;s mother insisted she could never keep up with her extracurriculars as a child. Was football another one of these? Did she wish she could have &lsquo;[navigated] the hate in her heart&rsquo; to stick with the sport? Is the &lsquo;ache&rsquo; she sought to meet the one for a past love of a sport? Sometimes heartbreak is just heartbreak, as much as Gareth Campesinos&rsquo;s love of football allegories may have conditioned me otherwise when someone mentions the ugly game: <em>For Whom The Belly Tolls</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scout yourself as a one-man team/You&rsquo;re a one-club man denied a testimonial&rsquo; and <em>Every Defeat a Divorce</em>&rsquo;s turning-around of <em>Three Lions</em> will probably remain for the rest of my life the only things inspired by football that have brought any beauty into the world.</p>
<p><em>Jubilee</em> is a beautiful album. It&rsquo;s probably the most accessible of Japanese Breakfast&rsquo;s albums, but retains the experimentation present on <em>Soft Sounds from Another Planet</em> on tracks such as <em>Posing in Bondage</em>, creating an incredible sense of sonic space between Zauner&rsquo;s vocals and instrumentation lending a certain eeriness to the to the track that really makes the feeling of distance evoked by the lyrics work. <em>Be Sweet</em> is just a fantastic funk-inspired track that proves itself an inescapable earworm. The wail of &lsquo;Hell is finding someone to love/And I can&rsquo;t have you&rsquo; on <em>In Hell</em> serves as an emotional highpoint of the album and underscores that this isn&rsquo;t really an album about loss in the abstract - not an album that would suit a pained sports metaphor - but an unrestrained ode to things that once were.</p>
<p>I worry that no matter how old I get, I will always find angsty pop-punk something that I get more than I would care to admit out of. <em>GUTS</em>, as an album, definitely evokes my teenage years - replete with questionable choices around capitalisation. This is strange given that I&rsquo;m in my early (honestly) thirties and Olivia Rodrigo still has the benefit of youth. It&rsquo;s probably something that doesn&rsquo;t warrant too much analysis: I could get into how milennials have seemingly grown into an extended adolesence that is a reaction to being raised by the latchkey kids that were Gen X, but I don&rsquo;t really think it&rsquo;s that deep. It&rsquo;s an album of good pop songs about heartbreak. I say good pop songs because I&rsquo;m choosing to ignore the &lsquo;rhyming&rsquo; couplet &lsquo;Lacy, oh Lacy/skin like puff pastry&rsquo; on <em>Lacy</em> that is just&hellip; questionable. If my skin is like puff pastry, it&rsquo;s time to switch up my skincare routine. That&rsquo;s an affliction, not a point of praise.</p>
<p>Courtney Barnett is the writer I wish I was. She has this sort of sardonic playfulness and ability to turn a phrase that inspires nothing but envy in me. &lsquo;Put me on a pedestal and I&rsquo;ll only disappoint you/Tell me I&rsquo;m exceptional, I promise to exploit you&rsquo; from <em>Pedestrian at Best</em> underscores this: she&rsquo;s deeply uncomfortable with the success that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s found and feels that she doesn&rsquo;t deserve it - &lsquo;Under-worked and over-sexed, I must express my disinterest/The rats are back inside my head, what would Freud have said?&rsquo; further underscoring this feeling of undeservedness. Given my own success in work and my own disaffection with, well, myself, it&rsquo;s a real &lsquo;it me, for real for real&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a contrast with <em>Lacy</em>&rsquo;s &lsquo;I want to fuck you with my jealousy dick&rsquo;, tending far more to &lsquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t want to jealously-fuck me.&rsquo; I think part of the reason that Barnett is a much better writer than me is that she wouldn&rsquo;t try to make the jealousy-dick bit work because she found it funny. Maybe.</p>
